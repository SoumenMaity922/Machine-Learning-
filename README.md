# Machine-Learning-

In the stroke data set, first i have preprocessed the data set to build some simple basic machine learning models. Also i have done the visualizations of the data set, so that before to get to build the machine learning models, we need to know what are different insights we can extract from the dataset. the visualization part and imputing the null values are done using Python.
